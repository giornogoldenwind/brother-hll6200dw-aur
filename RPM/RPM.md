# Note for RPM version

**Do not use this RPM version**

I couldn't really figure out how to change the patch file.  The path inside the
working AUR directory within `src/opt` changed slightly.

Originally, I wanted to adopt the package `brother-hll6200dw` on the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/brother-hll6200dw), but I abandoned
this effort after not being able to figure out how to make the existing patch
file function properly.

You're more than welcome to try to update the existing package yourself, or
suggest ideas on how to make it work.
