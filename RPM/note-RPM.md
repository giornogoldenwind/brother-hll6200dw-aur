# Note for RPM version

**Do not use this RPM version**

I couldn't really figure out how to change the patch file.  The path inside the
working AUR directory within `src/opt` changed slightly.

Originally, I wanted to adopt the package `brother-hll6200dw` on the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/brother-hll6200dw), but I abandoned
this effort after not being able to figure out how to make the existing patch
file function properly.
